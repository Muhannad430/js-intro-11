Node.js
JS used to be running only in browsers.

Node.js made JS to be executed in the machines without need of browsers.

When you install Node.js in local, you also get npm/npx

npm: node package manager
npx: node package executor


package = libraries = modules = these are lots of useful methods, prototypes or classes written by someone and shared with the others.


npx playwright test
npx cypress open


npm: can be consireded as the Apple Store for packages

npm is used one time to install a dependency
npx can be used frequently to run npm packages


npm install cypress -D
npm install cypress --save-dev

These flags stores dependencies as dev dependency
